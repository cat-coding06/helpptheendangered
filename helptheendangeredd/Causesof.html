              <h3>Water Pollution</h3>
              <p>
                Water pollution endangers marine and freshwater life by contaminating rivers, lakes, and oceans 
                with harmful substances such as plastics, oil, fertilizers, and industrial waste.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Toxic chemicals from factories and farms can poison fish, amphibians, and other aquatic creatures,
                  weakening their immune systems or causing death.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Plastic debris often gets mistaken for food by turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals,
                  leading to starvation or internal injury.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Polluted water also affects coral reefs, which are vital habitats for thousands of species.
                  Coral bleaching and death reduce biodiversity and food availability for many marine organisms.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Land Pollution</h3>
              <p>
                Land pollution mainly results from human activities such as deforestation, agriculture,
                mining, and improper waste disposal, all of which destroy or degrade natural habitats.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Deforestation for farming and urbanization removes trees that provide shelter and food 
                  for countless species, forcing animals to migrate or die.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Pesticides and fertilizers seep into the soil, harming insects, earthworms, and plants,
                  disrupting the entire food chain.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Solid waste and plastic left on land can entangle or choke animals that accidentally ingest them.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Mining and industrial waste release heavy metals into the ground, contaminating 
                  plants and water sources used by wildlife.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
              <p>
                Air pollution impacts both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by altering climate
                patterns and damaging living organisms.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Emissions from vehicles and factories release gases like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide,
                  and nitrogen oxides that lead to acid rain. Acid rain changes the pH of soil and water, 
                  making it toxic for fish, amphibians, and plants.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Smog and fine particles can damage animals’ respiratory systems, especially birds and
                  mammals living near cities or industrial zones.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, leads to rising temperatures and
                  shifting weather patterns that disrupt migration, breeding, and food availability.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  Melting ice caps and altered rainfall patterns force species to adapt quickly — 
                  something many cannot do, leading to population decline and extinction.
                </li>
              </ul>

        <h3>Poaching</h3>
            <p>Many species are unable to swiftly adjust to the changing rainfall 
              patterns and melting ice caps, which causes population reduction and 
               extinction.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Population decline and extinction result from many species' 
                     inability to quickly adapt to shifting rainfall patterns and melting ice caps.</li>

                   <li>Population decrease: Breeding populations decline as a result of poaching, which mostly 
                     targets adult animals, making it more difficult for species to recover.</li>

                    <li>Ecosystem balance loss: Whole ecosystems are upset when keystone species (such as tigers 
                      or elephants) are eliminated; flora may be destroyed or prey populations may become overpopulated.</li>

                   <li>Collateral damage: Non-target species, especially endangered ones, are frequently killed by 
                      poaching gear like snares, traps, and poisoned bait.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
          <h3>Wildlife Trafficking</h3>
               <p>The illicit commerce and cross-border movement of animals, plants, or their bodily parts is referred to 
                  as wildlife trafficking.  With an annual value of billions of dollars, it is among the biggest black 
                   arketplaces in the world.</p>

          <h2>Watch This: What Marine Animals Have to suffer because of Water Pollution</h2>
          <p>Wildlife trafficking is the illegal capture, trade, and sale of wild animals and their body parts for profit.
            It pushes many species — like elephants, tigers, and pangolins — closer to extinction while fueling global criminal networks.
            Stronger laws, enforcement, and awareness are crucial to stop this trade and protect endangered wildlife.</p>

    <!-- Habitat Loss -->

      <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>
    </div>

    <section class="cause_section">
      <div class="causeimg">
        <img src="images/forest-8011102_1280.jpg" alt="forest after deforestation">
      </div>

      <div class="causes_text">
        <p>
         <p>
              When human activities damage, alter, or disrupt the natural habitats of
              plants and animals, habitat loss occurs.  There are fewer places for wildlife
               to live, feed, and breed as a result of the clearing of forests for farming, 
              the expansion of towns into wilderness regions, the draining of wetlands, and 
              the pollution of the oceans.
         </p>

         <h3>What are the main causes of habitat loss></h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Deforestation: Trees that offer food, shelter, and nesting places are cut 
                      down when forests are cleared for agriculture, urbanization, or lumber.</li>

                  <li>Climate change: Ecosystems are changing more quickly than many species
                      can adjust due to rising temperatures, floods, and droughts.</li>

                 <li>Mining and agriculture: As farmlands are expanded and minerals 
                    are extracted, soil and water systems are changed, making it 
                      more difficult for native species to survive.</li>
               </ul>

        <h3>How does this affect endangered species?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Displacement: When animals are compelled to relocate to new
                                 or dangerous regions after losing their homes, it frequently 
                                 results in famine or conflict with people.</li>

                            <li>Extinction: When a species' specific habitat, such as mangroves, 
                                rainforests, or coral reefs, totally vanishes, the species that depends 
                                on it frequently has no other chance of surviving.</li>

                            <li>Fragmentation: Animal populations become isolated when habitats 
                                are split apart by farms or roads.  Over time, this weakens species 
                                by lowering genetic diversity and breeding possibilities.</li>
