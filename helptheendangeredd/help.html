          <p class="recoveryp">
            Recovering endangered species means helping populations of threatened or 
            endangered animals and plants return to a healthy, self-sustaining level w
            here they no longer need federal protection.
            Recovery focuses on restoring species’ numbers, habitats, and ecosystems so that
             extinction is no longer a risk. Once goals are met, the species can be delisted 
             (removed) from the Endangered Species Act.

        <div class="recoverysec2">
          <h3>How successful is the recovery plan?</h3>
          <p class="recoveryp">
           Species like the Eastern North Pacific gray whale, Steller sea lion,
            and humpback whale have recovered enough to be removed from the endangered list.
            However, many others—like the North Atlantic right whale and Hawaiian monk seal—remain endangered,
             showing that progress takes time and depends on strong protection and habitat restoration.
            Overall, recovery success varies by species, but NOAA’s long-term management and collaboration have 
            helped stabilize many populations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="recoverysec2">
           <h3>Who carries out recovery efforts?</h3>
              <p class="recoveryp">
                Recovery is a collaborative effort led by <strong>NOAA Fisheries</strong> for marine and anadromous species 
                and the <strong>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</strong> for land and freshwater species. 
                They work closely with state and tribal governments, research organizations, conservation groups, and 
                local communities to protect and restore habitats, monitor populations, and enforce environmental laws.
